# A CV supplement

## About me

I am mathematician with master's degree and over 8 year proffesional experience as academic teacher and minor scientific accomplishments. Teaching mainly computer science students on math, informatics and UX. Due to natural curiosity I am knowledgable in many fields, having dabbled with chemistry (attending an olympiad) in the middle school and physics in the high school.
